# Rosebox ðŸŒ¹

The Rosebox project is an effort to improve the CSS-in-JS experience by providing features like strong types, typed functions (e.g., [`linGrad`](https://www.rosebox.dev/api/#rb-vc-lingrad)), extra shorthand properties(e.g., [`marginX`](https://www.rosebox.dev/api/#rb-prop-paddingx), [`paddingX`](https://www.rosebox.dev/api/#rb-prop-paddingx), an object-based syntax for the values of complex properties (e.g., [`animation`](https://www.rosebox.dev/api/#rb-prop-animation)), and support for high-quality IntelliSense.

## IMPORTANT NOTE ðŸ“¢

Already today, you can use all the CSS properties in Rosebox. Missing ones on the API page only indicate that they are not **YET** strongly typed. The library exposes all untyped/loosely-typed properties by prefixing them with an underscore (e.g., `_borderImageStyle`, `_all`). Those loosely-typed props will have a type of `string`. When a property becomes strongly-typed, its underscore-prefixed version gets deprecated immediately. However, its removal may only be considered after a minimum of 2 major releases since the deprecationâ€”for example, if `_borderImageStyle` gets deprecated in 0.6.4, it means that it will be removed in 2.0.0.
