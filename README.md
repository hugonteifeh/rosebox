# Rosebox ðŸŒ¹

Rosebox is a Typescript library that models CSS in Typescript in a way that leverages the capabilities of Typescript's type system and Javascript as a programming language, providing strong types, functions, and overall a more structured syntax.

## IMPORTANT NOTE ðŸ“¢

You can already use all the CSS properties in Rosebox. Missing ones on the API page only indicates that they are not **YET** strongly typed. To use an untyped property, write the property's name prefixed by an underscore (e.g., `_borderImageStyle`, `_all`). Those untyped props will have a type of `string`. When a property gets a strong type, its underscore-prefixed counterpart gets deprecated immediately. However, its removal may only be considered after a minimum of 2 major releases since the deprecationâ€”for example, if `_borderImageStyle` gets deprecated in 0.6.4 it means that it will be removed in 2.0.0.
