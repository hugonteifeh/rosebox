# Rosebox

Rosebox is a typescript library for styling React components using functions. It provides a more structured and type-safe styling paradigm than CSS.

## Features

- Being written in Typescript, it makes use of Javascript's composition system.
- Expressive, it helps you model your styles in a simple functional way, UI state -&gt; Style.
- It's typed which helps VS code and other IDEs to provide its users IntelliSense and auto-completion.
- Because it's type-safe, it helps a lot with catching typos, which is not uncommon with strings.
- Provides interactive type signatures in the [API reference](https://www.rosebox.dev/api-reference) section. Just over over a type in the type signature to expand it (if expandable).</li>
